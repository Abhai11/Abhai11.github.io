Hey there :wave:

I am a software professional having experience of around 7+ years working in agile cross functional teams across the globe. Primarily I have been designing and developing backend applications using java with mix of various frameworks like quarkus, spring, spring-boot, thorntail. 

I am passionate about learning and working on latest technologies and in my free time try to explore different things and keep contributing to my inventory of 'Yet Another Useless Side Project' :grin:

Apart from programming I also like reading/learning about the world of finance & investments :chart:
